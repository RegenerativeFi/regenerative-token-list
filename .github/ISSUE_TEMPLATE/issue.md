Hello there, I would like the following token to be added to the celo-token-list.

```json
{
    "name": "TODO",
    "address": "TODO",
    "symbol": "TODO",
    "decimals": TODO,
    "chainId": 42220,
    "logoURI": "https://example.com/assets/TODO.svg"
}
```

<!---
Note: to ensure synchronicity with the corresponding brand, the logoURI should be hosted by the team responsible for deploying the token. However, the image can also be added to the '''/assets''' folder so that it is available in the same manner above (https://celo-org.github.io/celo-token-list/assets/{your_token_icon}.
